# Image classification using PyTorch

This repo is a part for following project 
[Web Scraping with product search relevance using NLP, rules and image classification](https://github.com/jithinanievarghese/product-search-relevance/blob/main/README.md)

Here we train a binary image classification model for e-commerce product image classification
and make inference on notebook [inference.ipynb](https://github.com/jithinanievarghese/image_classification_pytorch/blob/main/inference.ipynb)

Model architecture used is convolutional neural networks (CNNs)


# Usage

1. Install Requirements `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
2. `python3 train.py`
